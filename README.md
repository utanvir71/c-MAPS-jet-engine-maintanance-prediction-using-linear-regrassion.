This project implements a Remaining Useful Life (RUL) prediction system for turbofan engines using the CMAPSS dataset (FD001 subset) and Linear Regression. It includes data preprocessing, feature selection, training, evaluation, and visualization â€” along with engine health classification based on predicted RUL.
